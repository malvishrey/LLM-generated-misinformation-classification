- Fine-tuned Llama-2 model on Large Language Model (LLM) generated fake news dataset using QLoRA strategy. Moreover, experimented with few-shot learning on the PolitiFact dataset. The best accuracy reported was 66.25% for the fine-tuned model.- Fine-tuned Llama-2 model on Large Language Model (LLM) generated fake news dataset using QLoRA strategy.
